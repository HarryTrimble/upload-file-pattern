## Upload a photo or data

This guide explains how to help users upload photos or data in a service

### When to have users upload something

Where possible, avoid the need for users to upload something. Ask first:

- is the information needed to deliver the service?
- can the information come from an API or another government department? 

Uploading is a challenging interaction for many users, particularly on desktop devices. It's somewhat easier on mobile devices, but still presents challenges. Users lower on the [digital literacy scale](#) will struggle and may not be able to use a service if they need to upload as part of it.

Have users upload something only they can provide:

- data they collect about they're service or business
- photo of themselves, for example a passport
- document from abroad, for example a marriage certificate

### Show what to upload
