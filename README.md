## Upload a photo or data

This guide explains how to help users upload photos or data in a service

### When to have users upload something

Where possible, avoid the need for users to upload something - if it's evidence, could this information come via an API or directly from another government department?

Uploading is a challenging interaction for many users, particularly on desktop devices. It's somewhat easier on mobile devices, but still presents challenges. Users lower on the [digital literacy scale](#) will struggle and may not be able to use a service if they need to upload as part of it.

Have users upload something only they can provide:

- data they collect about they're service or business
- photo of themselves, for example for a passport
- document from abroad

### Show what to upload
